# Advent of Code 2021 with Rust

## To Run
I try to avoid external crates for this run of AoC. So you can just run 'cargo r --release <problem #>'.

The input file paths are hardcoded. Either change the paths or place them in the folder named 'input' in the top package/project folder. Each day named 'dayXX.txt'. (e.g. input for day 1 is day01.txt)
