# Advent of Code 2021 with Rust

I try to avoid external crates for this run of AoC.
To run, just do 'cargo r --release <problem #>'.

The input file paths are hardcoded. Save the AoC input as txt files, then place them in a folder named 'input' in the top package/project folder. Each day named 'dayXX.txt'. (e.g. input for day 1 is day01.txt).
